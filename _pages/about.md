Graduated as a Computer Engineer at the [Autonomous University of Baja California](https://www.uabc.mx/en/).

With more than eight years of experience as a software engineer, project leader and team leader, I had the opportunity to work with multiple technologies and cross-functional teams. I've worked with different levels of app complexity and quality, from proof-of-concept demos to commercialization-level applications. 

I am passionate about algorithms and software architecture, mainly focused on puzzles, but I enjoy problem-solving in general.

I feel very fortunate as I also had the opportunity to travel to many regions on Business Trips and trade shows, including international travel to South Korea (Samsung HQ), India (Samsung SRID offices), Amsterdam ([ISE - Integrated Systems Europe](https://iseurope.org/about-us)) and many cities in the USA: New York ([NRF - National Retail Federation](https://nrfbigshow.nrf.com/)), Las Vegas([CES](https://ces.tech)), Orlando ([Infocomm](https://infocommshow.org)), San Francisco([Samsung Developer Conference](https://samsungdeveloperconference.com/)), etc.

Outside of work, I try to stay up to date with latest tech news and gadgets (happy to try them by myself) and as a family guy, I love spending time with my wife and sons, nothing like a good movie night with caramel pop-corn and spicy chips.

Currently working on this page, soon I will upload some blogs, stay tuned!
