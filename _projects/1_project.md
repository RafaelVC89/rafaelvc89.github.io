This puzzle has been around for years, it lets the user move a single number piece to the empty slot and the objective is to arrange all the pieces in order.

You can also find the same puzzle with letters instead of numbers, or even images, in any case, the solution is the same.


The solution will be created using C++.

Let's start by creating the puzzle and making random movements:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include iostream

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Working on the solution, feel free to check the project repository: [Github Repository](https://github.com/RafaelVC89/puzzle1_numbers)
